# IODR_project
Web app for Lynd Lab IODR data
This web app pulls optical density data collected by the optical density sensors in the Lee Lynd lab. This data
is stored on Thingspeak's servers and the app uses the Thingspeak API to retrieve the data. The data is then
formatted with the pandas library and displayed using the plotly dash library. The web app is currently hosted
on free heroku servers.
